### Notes

***

The code `[nums[nums[i]] for i in range(len(nums))]` has better memory complexity because it doesn’t require additional memory allocation1. It creates a new list by accessing elements from the nums list using their indices. The memory complexity of this code is O(1) because it doesn’t use any extra space proportional to the size of the input1.
